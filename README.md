# Algorithm for Massive Data

Project 3: Link analysis
The task is to implement a ranking system based on the PageRank index. The entities to be ranked can be users (linked together if they reviewed at least a same book) or books (linked together if they have been reviewed at least by two different users), but you can choose different entities and/or different strategies to define links.
